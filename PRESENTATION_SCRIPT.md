### Understanding the Vulnerability (3 minutes)

#### What is Broken Authentication?
> "Broken Authentication occurs when authentication and session management are implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens."

**Point out the vulnerability card:**
- Weak or default passwords
- Inadequate session management
- Missing multi-factor authentication
- Exposed session identifiers
- Poor password storage

#### Business Impact
> "The impact is severe - we're talking about complete account takeover, data breaches, financial losses, and legal consequences."

**Highlight impact examples:**
- Account Takeover
- Data Breach
- Financial Loss
- Legal Issues

### Live Vulnerability Demonstration (8 minutes)

**Navigate to: Vulnerable Demo Tab**

#### 1. Basic Login Vulnerability (2 minutes)
> "Let's start with a basic login. Notice the demo credentials - these are intentionally weak."

**Actions:**
1. Show the login form with weak credentials
2. Login with `admin / admin123`
3. Point out the vulnerabilities displayed in real-time
4. Show the dashboard access with exposed session data

**Key Observations:**
- Plain text password storage
- Exposed session ID in response
- No session regeneration
- Complete user data exposure

#### 2. Brute Force Attack (2 minutes)
> "Now let's demonstrate how easy it is to perform a brute force attack against this vulnerable system."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Brute Force Attack" button
2. Watch the live attack progress
3. Show successful password cracking
4. Explain the lack of rate limiting

**Key Points:**
- No rate limiting protection
- Common passwords tried
- Attack succeeds quickly
- No account lockout

#### 3. Session Hijacking (2 minutes)
> "Next, let's look at session vulnerabilities that allow session hijacking."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Session Hijacking" button
2. Show exposed session cookies
3. Explain cookie vulnerabilities
4. Demonstrate potential XSS attacks

**Vulnerabilities Shown:**
- httpOnly: false (JavaScript accessible)
- secure: false (HTTP transmission)
- Predictable session IDs

#### 4. Password Reset Exploit (2 minutes)
> "Finally, let's see how poor password reset implementation can lead to account takeover."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Weak Password Reset" button
2. Show successful password change without authentication
3. Explain the critical vulnerability

**Critical Issue:**
- No identity verification
- No email confirmation
- Direct password changes allowed

### Secure Implementation (4 minutes)

**Navigate to: Secure Demo Tab**

#### Secure Login Features
> "Now let's see how proper security measures prevent these attacks."

**Demonstrate:**
1. Strong password requirements
2. Input validation
3. Rate limiting in action
4. Secure session management

**Try attacks against secure version:**
- Show rate limiting blocking brute force
- Demonstrate account lockout
- Show secure session handling

**Security Features Highlighted:**
- bcrypt password hashing
- Session regeneration
- Secure cookie settings
- Input validation
- Rate limiting (5 attempts/15min)
- Account lockout protection

---

### How to Fix (2 minutes)

**Navigate to: How to Fix Tab**

#### Code Examples
> "The fixes section provides comprehensive code examples for implementing secure authentication."

**Highlight key areas:**
1. **Password Security**
   - Strong password policies
   - bcrypt hashing implementation

2. **Session Management**
   - Secure session configuration
   - Session regeneration

3. **Authentication Controls**
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Account lockout mechanisms

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - TOTP implementation
   - SMS/Email verification

#### Security Checklist
> "Use this checklist to ensure your implementations are secure."

**Point out the interactive checklist** - audience can follow along

### Q&A and Key Takeaways (2-3 minutes)

#### Key Takeaways
1. **Never store passwords in plain text** - Always use bcrypt or Argon2
2. **Implement proper session management** - Secure cookies, regeneration, timeout
3. **Add rate limiting and account lockout** - Prevent brute force attacks
4. **Use multi-factor authentication** - Additional security layer
5. **Validate all inputs** - Prevent injection attacks
6. **Monitor and log security events** - Detect attacks early

#### Real-World Impact
> "These vulnerabilities are not theoretical - they're exploited daily. Companies like Equifax, Yahoo, and others have suffered massive breaches due to authentication failures."

#### Next Steps
- Review your current authentication implementations
- Use the provided security checklist
- Implement fixes incrementally
- Test thoroughly before deployment
